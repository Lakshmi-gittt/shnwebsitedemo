  {
    question: "Is it free?",
    answer:
      "Yes, completely. There is no registration fee, no subscription, no catch. Saturday Hack Night is a TinkerHub Foundation initiative — free and open to everyone.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need prior experience?",
    answer:
      "No. Each hack night has a difficulty rating — Beginner nights are genuinely beginner-friendly. If you can write a for-loop, you can ship something. The point is to learn by doing, not to show off what you already know.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I join if I missed the first few nights?",
    answer:
      "Yes — drop in to any single hack night. You don't need to attend all 5. Each event is self-contained with its own theme and challenge. Attending even one puts you in the pool for the offline finale.",
  },
  {
    question: "What counts as a valid submission?",
    answer:
      "A working prototype pushed to a public GitHub repo before midnight. It doesn't need to be polished, production-ready, or even feature-complete. A README that clearly explains what you built and a commit showing meaningful work is enough. Effort counts.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use any language, framework, or hardware?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. SHN is for tech makers — hardware and software, everything is in scope. Each hack night suggests a stack to help you get started, but it's never a rule. Build with Arduino, ESP32, a Raspberry Pi, a browser, a server, a CLI — whatever fits your idea. We explore depth across all of tech, not just web frameworks.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are projects selected for the finale?",
    answer:
      "The TinkerHub team reviews all submissions after each hack night. We look for creativity, effort, and completeness — not polish. Projects that attempt something ambitious and ship something real are the ones that get noticed. Top teams from the 5 online nights get invitations to the offline finale.",
  },
  {
    question: "My whole team gets invited to the offline finale?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If your project is selected, every member of your team (up to 2 people) receives the invitation. Travel and accommodation details are shared with selected teams individually.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't finish by midnight?",
    answer:
      "Midnight is a hard cut-off for submissions — we can't make exceptions or the leaderboard would be meaningless. But even an incomplete project is worth pushing. A half-built thing that shows direction and effort is better than nothing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where do I get help during the hack night?",
    answer:
      "The SHN Discord is live during every hack night with mentors and other builders. If you're stuck, ask — someone will help. The community is genuinely collaborative, not competitive.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is TinkerSpace Kochi?",
    answer:
      "TinkerSpace is TinkerHub's physical maker space in Kochi, Kerala — a lab, community hub, and hackathon venue. The SHN finale is a 24-hour in-person hackathon held there. Selected teams get full access to the space, tools, and mentors for the day.",
